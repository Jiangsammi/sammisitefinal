    <h2>Welcome to My Page!</h2>

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about exploring New York City, trying new foods, and sharing my experiences with others through social media. I know how hard and diffcult it could be to find a food spot in NYC. The idea behind NYC Spots is to give you a guide to food spots in the city — whether you're a local or just visiting.

      <h3>My Mission</h3>
      <p>
        My mission is simple: to help you find the best food and dessert spots in New York City. Whether you're looking for dessert spot, a cozy café, or a fancy restaurant. You can also review the place and share photos as well. I want to built a small community where everyone can share thier opionion on the taste, enviorment and pricing.

      <h3>Why I Created NYC Spots</h3>
      <p>
        I created this website because I believe in the power of food to bring people together. NYC is full of diverse, delicious, and unique dining options, and I wanted to make it easier for everyone to find the best spots. I’ve had many wonderful experiences tasting the food here, and I hope this website helps others make great memories too!
